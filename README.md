# flutstories

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

I'll be writing test driven and storyboarding according to [this (flutter storyboard project on github)](https://pub.dev/packages/storyboard)
and [this (storyboarding in flutter)](https://proandroiddev.com/storyboarding-widgets-in-flutter-96d79d9a72f0)
